# Contributing to Zayit

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few simple rules keep the project
clean and legally clear.

## License of your contributions (inbound = outbound)

Zayit is licensed under the **Zayit Public License**: the GNU AGPL v3,
plus a grant back to the maintainer, the "Powered by the technologies that drive
Zayit — https://zayitapp.com/" attribution and a trademark clause. See
[`LICENSE`](LICENSE) for the full text.

By submitting a contribution (pull request, patch, or any other form), you
license it under the same terms as the project. There is no CLA to sign.

## Open core and the grant back

Zayit is **open core** (see "Open core" in the [README](README.MD)): its core is
free under the Zayit Public License, and its official builds also include
proprietary modules, such as the smart siddur. Section 3 of the license lets
your contribution be part of those builds too:

- You **keep the copyright** on your contribution — there is no copyright
  assignment.
- By submitting it (or by distributing a modified version, in a fork for
  instance), you grant the maintainer a broad license on it, which allows
  distributing it under other terms too (including with proprietary modules),
  and a patent license.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Every commit must be signed off under the
[Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/). By
signing off, you certify that you wrote the code or otherwise have the right to
submit it under the project's license.

Add a sign-off line to each commit:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

The easy way is to use the `-s` flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your message"
```

To sign off the last commit you forgot to sign:

```bash
git commit --amend -s --no-edit
```

A CI check enforces that every commit in a pull request is signed off.
