## Vision
Zayit is a dream turned useful: a natural, fluid, almost obvious study experience.
The project will remain free by principle. Support is welcome and meaningful.
It is designed to stay non-commercial.
With God's help, Zayit will keep growing without losing its spirit.

## In the spirit of a study hall
Zayit is designed like a digital study hall: stable, fast, consistent.
You feel the calm of study: everything works, everything is in its place.
The text stays at the center, with respect and without distractions.

## A pro and natural interface
Zayit is built on JetBrains technologies, including Compose Desktop and Jewel.
Inspired by Google Chrome and IntelliJ IDEA, it offers a professional interface
that is fluid and natural, respects study, and does not strain the eyes.
Zayit is easy to use: you already know how, no learning curve.
Everything feels natural, intuitive, and within reach.

## Modular panels
The layout adapts instantly: organize the screen the way you want.
Show, hide, compare, and tailor reading to your study style.

## An exceptional search engine
A powerful engine designed to understand texts, not just find them.
The database was rebuilt to make search and navigation precise.
Every result helps you move forward on the topic, without wasting time.
Powered by Lucene and enhanced by AI for precision.
It is likely the most powerful engine ever built for this kind of study.
It finds words, forms, and variants with remarkable reliability.
Search is fast, stable, and guides you straight to the right source.

- Find a passage even from a partial word or approximate spelling.
- Even without vocalization or cantillation marks, search stays clear and reliable.
- A partial phrase is often enough to reach the right place.
- Clean, readable, immediate results, useful for review and lesson prep.

Simple to go fast, advanced to go far.

Simple search.
